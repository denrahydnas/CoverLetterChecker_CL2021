# CoverLetterChecker_CL2021
Code Louisville Python Cohort Project 2021

# In order to run this program, you will need the following:
==> a listing for a job, saved as a .txt file (a sample listing, 'test_listing.txt', is available for testing purposes)

==> a cover letter or resume, saved as a .txt file (a sample letter, 'test_letter.txt', is available for testing purposes)

==> PyDictionary 2.0.1 package installed - USE 'requirements.txt' TO LOAD

==> run app.py

# The program will:
==> allow User to submit Job Listing text, which is then parsed for keywords, compared to existing keyword list (ex: https://www.jobscan.co/blog/resume-words/#resume-keywords_)

==> allow user to see parsed keyword list or submit existing Cover Letter

==> allow user to add keyword to list if omitted

==> compare cover letter to keywords in job listing, return match results

==> check cover letter for additional commonly-found issues

==> suggest synonyms for overused words using PyDictionary


# Features List:
==> Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program

==> Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

==> Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

==> Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.

==> Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph)

==> Connect to PyDictionary and read data into your app


# Thanks!
