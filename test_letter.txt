I am writing to you regarding your company’s Customer Service Representative opening. I have been working as a Customer Care Specialist at Satellite TV Co. for more than 2 years now, and during that time I’ve developed impeccable phone manners and an ability to politely deal with disgruntled customers. I am accustomed to working on multiple projects simultaneously, and can offer new ideas to help your company grow and surpass all goals and objectives.

Duties at my previous company included making 60 cold calls a day to businesses and private individuals in order to solicit sales for goods and services. During my tenure, I implemented a new sales strategy, reducing training expenses by 90% and increasing the close ratio by 10% within 3 months.

My experience at Satellite TV Co. has helped me improve my leadership skills, hone my organizational skills, and has provided me with extensive knowledge of how to upsell services and goods to potential clients. I also worked at Scottrade as a Customer Service Intern, where I further cultivated useful customer service abilities while handling technical support for clients on a wide range of company products. Working there, I was able to resolve issues at a 90% rate and memorize an entire line of company products & services – including prices and special discounts.

I’m looking forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with you in more detail soon. I feel confident that I fulfill the requirements for the Customer Service Representative position at [TARGET COMPANY]. Thank you for your time and consideration.
