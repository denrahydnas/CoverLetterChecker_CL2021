
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for your posted Front End Designer role. My background is primarily in the live events industry, but web development and UX methodology have long been a personal focus of mine. This was especially beneficial in the past year, as my company worked to pivot from purely live events into expanding our virtual and hybrid capabilities. I've gone from handling logistics, staffing, and operations for live events to also handling graphics, design/development of event sites, and coordination of streaming systems for virtual ones. I love mixing creative thinking with practical solutions and coming up with new ways of resolving problems � and if I can learn new skills while I�m at it, that�s even better.

As a Production and Project Manager, I have evaluated projects for efficient production and guided teams with all varietes of creative temperaments to successful opening nights. I�ve collaborated in shaping the user experience for all aspects of events from small, local non-profit fundraisers to national sales
meetings and trade shows, whether live, hybrid, or virtual.

I feel I can contribute an essential point of view to your projects. I look forward to speaking with your team about what we can make together.

Thank you,
